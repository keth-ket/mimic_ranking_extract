This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployed Page: [https://mimic-ranking-extract.vercel.app/]

You can directly visit the website without download anything

## How to use the Program:

1. Record a video of the mimic result in game.
2. Make a text file that has all your members name, separate them by line.
3. Upload both to the website, then the Extract text button will be available.
4. Click on Extract Text, this should take a minute or two, depending on how long your video is (try to keep it less than a minute and make sure you are scrolling with steay speed).
5. The Result are displayed into 2 columns, one is the name of members who attacked an one is their score. This is already sorted in most damage.
   Enjoy!
